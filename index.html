    <h3 class="subheader">Regional investigations editor Texas/West – May 2019 to present</h3>

    <ul> 
      <li>Lead a three- to six-person team of investigative and data reporters who expose problems and hold powerful people to account in the region they cover through in-depth and investigative stories that appeared in USA TODAY and network newspapers throughout the region. As the top investigative editor for the region, also communicated and collaborated with network properties across several states to keep tabs on local investigative work and offer editorial, reporting and data assistance when needed.  
      <li>Directed the reporting, writing and presentation of a <a href=https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/hostagetoheat/texas-heat-summer-temperatures-electricity-power-cut-off/site/gatehousenews.com">five-part series</a> that revealed that hundreds of Texans were dying in their homes as state power regulators allowed private utility providers to quickly shut off power to vulnerable, chronically ill and low-income residents. The stories also showed that regulators chipped away at utility protections as both temperatures and deaths grew across the state and that amid lacking state and federal worksite regulations, Texas workers were dying of heat-related causes at a rate higher than any other state in the country. The series was published online and in print by multiple newspapers across the region and led to both state legislative and congressional hearings on heat-related deaths and utility regulation.
      <li>Directed teh reporting, writing and presentation of a <A href=https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/a-world-rocked/>three-part series</a> investigating the explosive growth of Texas' quarrying industry and it impacts on the environment and health of the surrounding communities. The series revealed Texas' lax regulation of the industry fueld a 1,690% increase in mining operations, and that despite multiple lawsuits and serious concerns in the medical community over the consequences of the massive and fast expansion of the industry, lawmakers and regulators failed to implement meaningful oversight. Along with a local TV partner, the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>hosted a well-attended community forum on the issue, and the stories and community response prompted state lawmakers to form a committee to study regulation of the industry ahead of the 2021 legislative session.

      <li>Successfully directed the transition from a print-first, traditional bureau with storied journalists to a nearly entirely new cohort of investigative and multimedia journalists with a digital-first focus. We rejuvenated the bureau's long-standing reputation as a leader in breaking political news and accountability journalism.

It immediately led state lawmakers to renew calls for stronger laws to protect cyclists.
